      <p>It can feel overwhelming sometimes considering all the programming languages to choose from when deciding to learn how to program. The good news is; it's less important than you believe. Learning any language well will give you the fundamental skills you need and you will be able to apply these skills to another programming language you eventually learn.
      </p>

      <p>Go ahead and select from the below questions below to find out which programming language would be a great fit for you to start but, at the end of the day, remember that starting anywhere is more than likely great.

      <h4 id="output1"><u>C#</u> would be a great choice for you!
        <br><br>
        C#[b] (pronounced C sharp) is a general-purpose, multi-paradigm programming language encompassing strong typing, imperative, declarative, functional, generic, object-oriented (class-based), and component-oriented programming disciplines.[15] It was developed around 2000 by Microsoft within its .NET initiative and later approved as a standard by Ecma (ECMA-334) and ISO (ISO/IEC 23270:2006). C# is one of the programming languages designed for the Common Language Infrastructure.
        <br><br>
        C#'s development team is led by Anders Hejlsberg. The most recent version is C# 7.3, which was released in 2018 alongside Visual Studio 2017 version 15.7.2.[16]

      <h4 id="output2"><u>CSS</u> would be a great choice for you!
        <br><br>
        Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is a style sheet language used for describing the presentation of a document written in a markup language like HTML.[1] CSS is a cornerstone technology of the World Wide Web, alongside HTML and JavaScript.[2]
        <br><br>
        CSS is designed to enable the separation of presentation and content, including layout, colors, and fonts.[3] This separation can improve content accessibility, provide more flexibility and control in the specification of presentation characteristics, enable multiple web pages to share formatting by specifying the relevant CSS in a separate .css file, and reduce complexity and repetition in the structural content.
      </h4>

      <h4 id="output3"><u>Ruby</u> would be a great choice for you!
        <br><br>
        Ruby is a dynamic, interpreted, reflective, object-oriented, general-purpose programming language. It was designed and developed in the mid-1990s by Yukihiro "Matz" Matsumoto in Japan.
        <br><br>
        According to the creator, Ruby was influenced by Perl, Smalltalk, Eiffel, Ada, and Lisp.[12] It supports multiple programming paradigms, including functional, object-oriented, and imperative. It also has a dynamic type system and automatic memory management.
